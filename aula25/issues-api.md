## Common Error Handling

This section describes the error handling that is done in every endpoint that produces these erros. This is presented in a separate section to avoid repeating these descriptions wherever it applies.

Every error response has an `application/json` body with the content described for each error.

### 400 - Bad request

Every time the request contains a URI with and invalid QueryString or a Body with invalid Json content for that specific request, the response has a 400 status code with the following sample body:

- Body:

  ```json
      {
        "error": "The request query string is invalid",
        "uri": "/b4/api/issues/?InvalidQueryString",
      }
  ```

### 404 - Not found

Every time the request contains a URI for a resource not managed by the API, the response has a 404 status code with the following sample body.

- Body:

  ```json
      {
        "error": "Resource not found",
        "uri": "/b4/api/issues/notfoundissue",
      }
  ```
